== Introduction

The text-mining problem to be addressed in the context of the AS-A Use Case is the extraction of structured information (domain specific topics, images / figures, captions etc.) from unstructured bibliographic resources (i.e. PDF documents).

== Data Processing Scenarios

In AS-A, we have outlined the following data processing scenarios:

Scenario #1:

 * <<pdfextractor.adoc#, Extracting PDF Artifacts such as outline, main text, figures and tables  >>
 * <<grapevarieties.adoc#, Extracting Grape Varieties from the main text >>
 * <<agrovocextractor.adoc#, Extracting AgroVoc terms from the main text >>

Scenario #2:

 * <<rssfeedreader.adoc#, Retrieve Documents from FoodSafety and WaterWorld >>
 * <<geonamesextractor.adoc#, Extract Geolocations from the retrieved RSS feeds >>
 * <<geopoliticalextractor.adoc#, Associate Geolocations with the FAO Geopolitical Ontology >>
